# OIBSIP_webdevelopment_Task1
Project Title: Personal Portfolio Webpage
ðŸ“– Objective
The objective of this project is to create a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. It showcases basic web development skills, including layout creation, image embedding, hyperlinking, and use of semantic HTML elements. This project serves as an introductory exercise for practicing clean HTML structure, improving attention to syntax, and presenting personal/professional information.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic structure, forms, links, images)

CSS (linked externally â€“ though contains a typo)

Web Browser (for preview and testing)

Text Editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)

ðŸš€ Steps Performed
Basic HTML Boilerplate Setup

Started with <!DOCTYPE html> and added <html>, <head>, and <body> sections.

Set metadata like character encoding and viewport settings.

Linked an External Stylesheet

Used <link> to include style.css, but there is a typo (stlyesheet instead of stylesheet).

Added a Container Division

Wrapped the content in a <div class="container"> for layout styling.

Created a Header Section

Embedded a profile image using <img> (note: missing a space between attributes and missing alt).

Added an introductory heading and a short bio paragraph.

Used semantic tag <header> (correctly used but missing a closing tag for <h1>).

Built an About Section

Used <section class="about"> (typo: wrote sect0in).

Added a heading and description of personal goals and current learning.

Created a Resume Section

Included a download link to a resume (note: the link goes to Gmail and wonâ€™t work for downloads â€“ needs a direct file link instead).

Made a Contact Section

Shared contact details like email and location.

Again used a section tag, but with a typo: sectioin instead of section.

âœ… Outcome
This project demonstrates foundational knowledge in HTML and the structure of a basic personal website. It helped improve attention to syntax, semantic markup, and the use of common HTML tags. While there are a few syntax and structural mistakes (see below), itâ€™s a great first step toward building more polished, responsive, and interactive websites using CSS and JavaScript in future projects.

âš  Issues to Fix in Your Code
Here are the issues that should be corrected:

âœ… meta name="viewpoint" â†’ should be viewport

âœ… <link rel="stlyesheet" â†’ should be stylesheet

âœ… <img ...your photo" â†’ needs space between attributes and an alt tag

âœ… <h1>Hello, I am...</h1> â†’ the closing </h1> is mistyped as <h1>

âœ… <h2>About Me<h2> â†’ closing </h2> is mistyped as <h2>

âœ… Tag typos: sect0in, sectioin â†’ should be section

âœ… Resume download link leads to Gmail â€” replace with a direct file link

âœ… Missing closing tags on some <p> elements
